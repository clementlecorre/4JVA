It ships with a simple scheduling backend out of the box, and as initial development settles, an API will develop to enable pluggable backends. The goal is to provide a smooth out-of-box experience for simple use cases, and allow swapping in more powerful backends, like `Mesos`, for large scale production deployments. \n ', 'Docker swarm courses', 0.0)
